Programming test for a company admission. 

Given the file "anyos.txt" it is requested that an executable program be made from
console that reads the years that appear in said file, and for each year it is calculated
whether it is a leap or not. The output will be written to a text file.

Example:
            in              out
            2000            2000;Bisiesto
            2001            2001;No Bisiesto

It may be the case that a line does not contain a year, if not a random text.
In this case, the line must be discarded.

The output file will be sorted by year in ascending order (the entrance is messy).

Both the input and output files (complete paths including the
name of the file itself) will be provided as program arguments
in its invocation (the first parameter will be the input file and the second the
output file).

There is an executable JAR file.
